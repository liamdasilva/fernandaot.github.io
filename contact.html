                            <p>
                                If your child is struggling with daily activities, school skills, managing big emotions, sleep, toileting, or eating, occupational therapy can help.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <h3>Do I need a referral from a doctor?</h3>
                            <p>
                                No referral is required for private occupational therapy services. However, some insurance plans may require a doctor's referral for coverage.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Sessions can take place in your home, community settings, at your child's school, or virtually, depending on your preference.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <p>
                                Treatment length varies based on individual needs and goals. Some children benefit from short-term intervention, while others may need longer-term support. Other families prefer to stick to parent consultation only. We can discuss this after the initial assessment.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Many extended health care benefit plans reimburse part of occupational therapy services. I would recommend contacting your insurer to ask about coverage.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                You are in full control in terms of how long you want to engage in the therapeutic process. There is no pressure to commit to treatment sessions after the initial assessment, and you can stop treatment at any time.
