                            <p>
                                If your child is struggling with daily activities like dressing, eating, playing, or learning, 
                                occupational therapy might help. Common signs include difficulty with fine motor skills, 
                                sensory sensitivities, attention challenges, or delayed development.

                            <p>
                                No referral is required for private occupational therapy services. However, some insurance 
                                plans may require a doctor's referral for coverage. I can help you understand your specific requirements.

                            <p>
                                I work with infants, children, and adolescents from birth through 18 years of age. 
                                My approach is tailored to each child's developmental stage and individual needs.

                                Sessions can take place in your home, community settings, or schools, depending on your 
                                child's needs and goals. I believe in providing therapy in natural environments where 
                                skills will be used.

                            <p>
                                Treatment length varies based on individual needs and goals. Some children benefit from 
                                short-term intervention, while others may need longer-term support. We'll discuss this 
                                during our initial consultation.

                                I accept extended health insurance and provide receipts for reimbursement. Direct billing 
                                is available for some insurance providers. I can help you understand your coverage options.
