                    <p>
                        I am a Registered Occupational Therapist with a deep passion for pediatric therapy. My journey in occupational therapy 
                        began with a desire to make a meaningful difference in the lives of children and families. I believe that every child 
                        deserves the opportunity to participate fully in the activities that are important to them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My approach to therapy is grounded in evidence-based practice, family-centered care, and a commitment to understanding 
                        each child's unique needs and strengths. I work closely with families to develop individualized treatment plans that 
                        support children in reaching their full potential.

                        My therapeutic approach is built on the foundation of family-centered care, where I work collaboratively with families 
                        to understand their goals, concerns, and priorities. I believe that parents are the experts on their children, and my 
                        role is to provide the professional knowledge and tools to support their child's development.

                                I partner with families to ensure that therapy goals align with family values and priorities. Every decision 
                                is made with the family's input and consent.

                        The PLAY Project (Play and Language for Autistic Youngsters) is an evidence-based early intervention program 
                        designed to help children with autism spectrum disorders develop social communication skills through play.

                        <h3>What is The PLAY Project?</h3>
                        <p>
                            The PLAY Project uses a relationship-based approach that focuses on following the child's lead, building 
                            on their natural interests and motivations. Through play-based activities, children learn to engage 
                            socially, communicate effectively, and develop meaningful relationships.
