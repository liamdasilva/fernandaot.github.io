                        <p class="lead">
                            I grew up with a neurodiverse brain, and still experience what it’s like to live with what others call a ‘disability’. Although at many points in my life it has been challenging to work around my learning disabilities, sensory processing differences, and anxiety, I am beyond grateful since this personal experience fueled my dedication to help kids, who like me, just need a bit of extra encouragement, support, and love to reach their fullest potential.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h2>Why I Became an OT</h2>
                        <p>
                            I began my education learning over five years as a volunteer at Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital while I was a 
                            student at The University of Toronto. From there, after completing my Master of Science in Occupational Therapy at 
                            McMaster University, I knew I wanted to specialize in pediatrics. My own experiences growing up with a learning disability taught 
                            me that the right support at the right time can be transformative in a child's functioning, self-esteem, and participation in daily 
                            life.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h2>My Promise to Families</h2>
                        <p>
                            I believe every child deserves to participate fully in the activities that matter to them. Whether it's learning to write their name, 
                            enjoying mealtimes for the first time, or playing confidently with friends, I'm here to help your child thrive. Most importantly, I see 
                            challenges not as deficits, but as different ways of experiencing the world that deserve understanding, support, and celebration.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h2>Why I Love What I Do</h2>
                        <p>
                            I also deeply value the relationships I build with families. Parents are the true experts on their children, and I consider 
                            myself privileged to support families on their journey. Together, we celebrate successes, navigate challenges, and work toward 
                            meaningful goals that enhance the child's quality of life.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h2>In My Free Time</h2>
                        <p>
                            I have the pleasure of being an Assistant Clinical Professor (Adjunct) at McMaster University with a focus on teaching future occupational therapists in 
                            the pediatric term. To give back to my community, I enjoy being a volunteer therapist at Family Service Toronto sharing information and strategies to staff 
                            in the field of pediatric occupational therapy. I am also a consultant at Boomerang Health Powered by SickKids supporting other therapists with 
                            mentorship.
