                        <p class="lead">
                            I grew up with a neurodiverse brain, and still experience what it’s like to live with what others call a ‘disability’. Although at many points in my life it has been challenging to work around my learning disabilities, sensory processing differences, and anxiety, I am beyond grateful since this personal experience fueled my dedication to help kids, who like me, just need a bit of extra encouragement, support, and love to reach their fullest potential.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h2>Why I Became an OT</h2>
                        <p>
                            After completing my Masters in Occupational Therapy at McMaster University, I knew I wanted to specialize in pediatrics. 
                            My own experiences taught me that the right support at the right time can be transformative. I became particularly 
                            passionate about feeding therapy and autism interventions because I understand how these challenges can impact a 
                            child's confidence and family dynamics.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h2>My Promise to Families</h2>
                        <p>
                            I believe every child deserves to participate fully in the activities that matter to them. Whether it's learning to 
                            write their name, enjoying mealtime, or playing confidently with friends, I'm here to help your child thrive. 
                            Most importantly, I see challenges not as deficits, but as different ways of experiencing the world that deserve 
                            understanding, support, and celebration.

                        The PLAY Project, both of which are gold-standard interventions in their respective areas.

                    <h2>Why I Love What I Do</h2>
                    <p>
                        What I love most about being an occupational therapist is witnessing the joy and confidence that comes 
                        when a child masters a new skill or overcomes a challenge. Whether it's a child taking their first bite 
                        of a new food, successfully completing a craft project, or playing independently with peers, these moments 
                        remind me why I chose this profession.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also deeply value the relationships I build with families. Parents are the true experts on their children, 
                        and I consider myself privileged to support families on their journey. Together, we celebrate successes, 
                        navigate challenges, and work toward meaningful goals that enhance the child's quality of life.
