                            Hi there! I'm Fernanda, and I am a Registered Occupational Therapist with a deep passion for pediatric therapy. 
                            My journey in occupational therapy began with a desire to make a meaningful difference in the lives of children and families.

                    <h2>My Mission</h2>
                    <p>
                        I believe that every child deserves the opportunity to participate fully in the activities that are important to them. 
                        My mission is to help kids participate in meaningful activities while valuing integrity, family-centered care, 
                        and compassion. Whether it's learning to write their name, playing with friends, or sitting at the dinner table 
                        with their family, I'm here to support children in reaching their goals.
                    </p>

                    <h2>My Background</h2>
                    <p>
                        My approach to therapy is grounded in evidence-based practice, family-centered care, and a commitment to understanding 
                        each child's unique needs and strengths. I work closely with families to develop individualized treatment plans that 
                        support children in reaching their full potential.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout my career, I have developed expertise in various areas of pediatric occupational therapy, including 
                        feeding difficulties, sensory processing challenges, fine motor development, and social-emotional regulation. 
                        I am particularly passionate about helping families navigate feeding challenges and supporting children with autism 
                        spectrum disorders through evidence-based interventions.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Why I Love What I Do</h2>
                    <p>
                        What I love most about being an occupational therapist is witnessing the joy and confidence that comes 
                        when a child masters a new skill or overcomes a challenge. Whether it's a child taking their first bite 
                        of a new food, successfully completing a craft project, or playing independently with peers, these moments 
                        remind me why I chose this profession.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also deeply value the relationships I build with families. Parents are the true experts on their children, 
                        and I consider myself privileged to support families on their journey. Together, we celebrate successes, 
                        navigate challenges, and work toward meaningful goals that enhance the child's quality of life.
