# How to Enable GitHub Pages

## Step 1: Go to your Repository Settings
1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/liamdasilva/fernandaot.github.io
2. Click on **"Settings"** (in the top menu of your repository)

## Step 2: Navigate to Pages Settings
1. In the left sidebar, scroll down and click on **"Pages"**

## Step 3: Configure Source
1. Under **"Source"**, select **"Deploy from a branch"**
2. Choose **"main"** as the branch
3. Choose **"/ (root)"** as the folder
4. Click **"Save"**

## Step 4: Wait for Deployment
1. GitHub will show a message saying "Your site is being built from the main branch"
2. It may take a few minutes for the site to be available
3. Once ready, your site will be accessible at:
   **https://liamdasilva.github.io/fernandaot.github.io**

## Step 5: Custom Domain (Optional)
If you want to use a custom domain (like fernandaot.com):
1. In the same Pages settings, under "Custom domain"
2. Enter your domain name (e.g., fernandaot.com)
3. Make sure to configure DNS settings at your domain registrar

## Images Still Needed
The website is functional but needs these images:
- `images/fernanda-headshot.jpg` - Professional headshot
- `images/sos-feeding-logo.png` - SOS Feeding certification logo
- `images/play-project-logo.png` - PLAY Project certification logo

## Current Status
✅ Website structure is complete
✅ All code is deployed to GitHub
⏳ GitHub Pages needs to be enabled (manual step)
⏳ Images need to be added

Once you enable GitHub Pages, the site will be live!
