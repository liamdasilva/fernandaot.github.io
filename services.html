                        I provide occupational therapy services for infants, children, and adolescents. After an assessment, a report is emailed to you within 3 business days. While you and your family are under my care, I am available for support via email. I don't bill for 20 minutes of my time while you are under my care. Administrative time, such as for video or phone calls, is billed at $100/hour beyond that timeframe. Ongoing treatment is available virtually, and in person within the West Toronto/Etobicoke area.
