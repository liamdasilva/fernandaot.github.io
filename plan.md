# Project: Restructure Fernanda's OT Website to Multi-Page Structure

## Overview

Restructure Fernanda Da Silva's occupational therapy website to match the original Wix site structure with separate pages for each section. The current single-page design needs to be converted to individual HTML pages to match the original site's navigation.

## Multi-Page Structure

Based on the original Wix site, create separate pages:
- **index.html** - Home page
- **about.html** - About Me page  
- **approach.html** - My Approach page
- **play-project.html** - The PLAY Project page
- **services.html** - Services & Fees page
- **contact.html** - Contact Me page
