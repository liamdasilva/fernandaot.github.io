                        <h2>Neurodiversity Affirming Perspective</h2>
                        <p>
                            The neurodiversity affirming perspective is the idea that kids differ in their unique skills and abilities. These differences are viewed as natural rather than "deficits" that require "fixing".

                        <h2>Occupation-Focused Delivery Model</h2>
                        <p>
                            At the heart of everything that I do is promoting occupation. I define 'occupation' as any activity that is meaningful to you or to your child in the realm of self-care, productivity, and leisure. I prioritize maximizing activity participation in chosen activities, rather than "correcting" behaviour.

                        <h2>Parent-Implemented Approaches</h2>
                        <p>
                            Empowering parents is a hallmark of my clinical practice. I believe that you are the expert on your child, and anything that I recommend should respect your values, wishes, and goals. Strategies that I share to help your child should be straight-forward, easy to implement, and low cost.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Strategies and interventions that I recommend are supported by research and have been validated for use with specific pediatric populations.

                            I build on your child's strengths, highlighting their accomplishments and resilience.

                    <h2>Theoretical Models & Therapeutic Frameworks</h2>
                    <p>
                        I use a variety of evidence-based occupational therapy models and frameworks to guide my practice. These approaches ensure that every intervention is grounded in research while remaining engaging and developmentally appropriate for each child.

                            <h3>Play-Based Intervention</h3>
                            <p>
                                I use play as the primary vehicle for learning and skill development. Play is a child's natural way of exploring their world and developing new abilities.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <p>
                                I use evidence-based motor learning theories to help children develop and refine their gross and fine motor skills and coordination.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I use a developmental frame of reference to root my interventions in the typical milestones achieved during childhood and adolescents. I meet your child where they are at in terms of their development and present the just right level of challenge to promote growth.

                            <p>
                                I use the PEO-P model by considering the dynamic relationship between the Person (the child), the Environment (their home, school, community), the Occupation (the activities they want or need to do), and how the interaction of these three elements leads to Performance (the ability to do the activity successfully).
                            </p>

                            <h3>Cognitive Behavioral Interventions</h3>
                            <p>
                                I use Cognitive Behavioral Interventions to help a child understand the connection between their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. These interventions improve emotional regulation by helping kids build their self-awareness and coping skills.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <p>
                                This is a fundamental principle to my practice. It means I carefully select an activity that is not too easy (which could lead to boredom and disengagement) and not too difficult (which could lead to frustration and avoidance). The "just right challenge" is a task that is perfectly balanced to stretch a child's skills while still allowing for success. It builds on their current abilities and promotes growth in a motivating and achievable way.
