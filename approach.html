                        <p>
                            Strategies and interventions that I recommend are supported by research and have been validated for use with specific pediatric populations.

                            I build on your child's strengths, highlighting their accomplishments and resilience.

                        <p>
                            Building a strong therapeutic relationship is key to successful treatment, and enjoyment in the therapy process.

                        <h2>Neurodiversity Affirming Perspective</h2>
                        <p>
                            The neurodiversity affirming perspective is the idea that kids differ in their unique skills and abilities. These differences are viewed as natural rather than "deficits" that require "fixing".

                        <h2>Occupation-Focused Delivery Model</h2>
                        <p>
                            At the heart of everything that I do is promoting occupation. I define 'occupation' as any activity that is meaningful to you or to your child in the realm of self-care, productivity, and leisure. I prioritize maximizing activity participation in chosen activities, rather than "correcting" behaviour.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Parent-Implemented Approaches</h2>
                        <p>
                            Empowering parents is a hallmark of my clinical practice. I believe that you are the expert on your child, and anything that I recommend should respect your values, wishes, and goals. Strategies that I share to help your child should be straight-forward, easy to implement, and low cost.
                        </p>

                    <h2>Therapeutic Methods</h2>
                    <p>
                        I use a variety of therapeutic approaches and techniques, always selecting the methods that best meet each 
                        child's individual needs and learning style. My interventions are play-based, engaging, and designed to 
                        promote skill development in a natural and enjoyable way.

                                Using play as the primary vehicle for learning and skill development. Play is a child's natural 
                                way of exploring their world and developing new abilities.
