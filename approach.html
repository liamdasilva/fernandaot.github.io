                    <p class="lead">
                        My therapeutic approach is built on the foundation of family-centered care, where I work collaboratively with families 
                        to understand their goals, concerns, and priorities. I believe that parents are the experts on their children, and my 
                        role is to provide the professional knowledge and tools to support their child's development.

                    <h2>My Approach & Expertise</h2>
                    <p>
                        My therapy approach is grounded in evidence-based practice, family-centered care, and a deep commitment to understanding 
                        each child's unique needs and strengths. I work closely with families to develop individualized treatment plans that 
                        support children in reaching their full potential while celebrating their individual differences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout my career, I have developed expertise in various areas of pediatric occupational therapy, including 
                        feeding difficulties, sensory processing challenges, fine motor development, and social-emotional regulation. 
                        I am particularly passionate about helping families navigate feeding challenges and supporting children with autism 
                        spectrum disorders through evidence-based interventions.

                <div class="approach-philosophy">
                    <h2>Core Philosophy</h2>
                    <p>
                        Every child is unique, and their therapy should be too. I believe that effective occupational therapy happens when 
                        we meet children where they are, build on their strengths, and support them in developing the skills they need 
                        to participate fully in their daily activities. My approach emphasizes collaboration, respect, and evidence-based 
                        practice to achieve meaningful outcomes for children and families.

                        <h2>Family-Centered Care</h2>
                        <p>
                            I partner with families to ensure that therapy goals align with family values and priorities. Every decision 
                            is made with the family's input and consent. I recognize that parents know their children best and work to 
                            empower families with strategies they can use in their daily routines.

                            that children receive the most effective treatment available. I continuously update my knowledge and skills 
                            to provide the highest quality care.
