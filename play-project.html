                    <h2>What is The PLAY Project?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The PLAY Project uses a relationship-based approach that focuses on following the child's lead, building 
                        on their natural interests and motivations. Through play-based activities, children learn to engage 
                        socially, communicate effectively, and develop meaningful relationships.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This innovative program recognizes that children with autism learn best when they are engaged, motivated, 
                        and having fun. By meeting children where they are and building on their strengths and interests, 
                        The PLAY Project helps children develop the foundational skills needed for social communication and learning.
                    </p>
